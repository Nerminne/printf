This is a README file for a _printf function that mimic the original printf function in some aspects in addition to some new features.

**To use this function you should write the name of the function followed by ("") then you add what you want to print between the two double quotes as in the next example:

	_printf("Enter what you want to print here");

** _printf function offer some formats that can be access by using % before the format specifier that the function offer as in the next example:

	_printf("%s", "if you fail, fail forward");

** _printf function is a regularly updated function, for now it contains the following format specifier that you can use:

%s >> which is used as a placeholder for an argument of type string.
%c >> which is used as a placeholder for an argument of type character.
%d >> which is used as a placeholder for an argument of type decimal signed integer.
%i >> it acts the same as the previous %d in this function but it vary in the scanf function.
%r >> which is used as a placeholder for an argument of type string but it print it in reverse.
%R >> which is used as a placeholder for an argument of type string but it is printed in ROT13 encryption algorithm format.
